# üç¥ What's Cookin'? üç¥Ô∏è

## Abstract
What's Cookin is an interactive, web-based application that allows users to view a list of recipes they want to cook and plan their meals and shopping trips accordingly. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and APIs, we built our app to allow users to view recipes, filter recipes by tag, search recipes by name, and save their favorite recipes in a single place. Users are able to filter recipes and search for recipes by name on their favorites page as well. When a user clicks on any recipe, they will be provided with a list of ingredients with their quantities, an estimate of the total cost to make this recipe, and step-by-step instructions for cooking.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone [this repo](https://github.com/Eleanorgruth/whats-cookin) to your local computer.
2. `CD` into that directory, run `npm install`, and then `npm start`. You should see "Project is now running at http://localhost:8080/"
3. Copy and paste the link that appears in your terminal in your browser.
4. `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server. Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems.

## Context
What's Cookin' is a two-part group project that is completed during Weeks 2 and 4 of Module 2 at Turing School of Software Development and Design. We worked collaboratively in teams of four, implementing mob coding, driver-navigator paired coding, and some independent coding. We used a thorough DTR, calendaring, GitHub project board, daily stand-ups, and the GitHub workflow to communicate while balancing project work with our full-time coursework and working across multiple time zones. The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/whats-cookin-part-one.html).
